# IMDB Movies Web Scraping Application Documentation

This application uses **TypeScript**, **Axios**, and **Cheerio** to scrape the IMDB movies web page and extract information about the movies. Below are these technologies and how they are used in the application:

## TypeScript 

TypeScript is an open-source programming language that builds on JavaScript. It offers a static type system that helps developers catch errors in code before it runs. Additionally, TypeScript integrates easily with Node.js and other web technologies.

In this application, TypeScript is used to define the types of variables and functions used to perform web scraping. This helps prevent errors and makes the code easier to read and understand.

## Axios

Axios is a JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from either the client or server. It allows for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, among others, and efficiently handles responses.

In this application, Axios is used to make HTTP requests to the IMDB web page and retrieve the page's HTML. This allows Cheerio to parse the HTML and extract the necessary information.

## Cheerio

Cheerio is an HTML parsing and manipulation library based on the jQuery syntax. It allows for specific information to be searched and extracted from an HTML document and manipulate the DOM.

In this application, Cheerio is used to parse the HTML code retrieved by Axios and extract information about the movies. CSS selectors are used to find specific elements in the HTML, such as movie titles, ratings, and synopses.

## Conclusion

In summary, **TypeScript**, **Axios**, and **Cheerio** are essential technologies for the development of this IMDB movies web scraping application. TypeScript allows for defining variable and function types to avoid errors, while Axios is responsible for making HTTP requests and Cheerio is used for parsing and extracting information from web pages. Together, these technologies make it possible to create
